<h3 id="accessible-voice-assistant">Accessible Voice Assistant</h3>

Inspired by the tsunami of interest around ChatGPT, I was driven to create a voice activate wrapper around ChatGPT. This application allows the user to speak to their computer and have it respond in kind. The application is designed to be as accessible as possible, with a focus on the user experience.

<h3 id="spotify-assistant">Spotify Assistant</h3>

I am obsessive about keeping up to date with musicians' releases on Spotify. Every week, if an artists I follow releases a new song, I listen to it. If they release an album, I listen to that album. This application make that process easier, by creating playlists of new songs and albums such that I can stay up to date with my favorite artists as efficiently as possible.

<h3 id="sheeeeshbot">SheeeeshBot</h3>

Whenever I hear a song that makes me crunch my face in appreciation, I save that song to a playlist called "Sheeeesh". In hopes of experimenting with the Twitter API before it was placed behind a paywall, I created a bot that would tweet out the latest additions to my "Sheeeesh" playlist so all the world could share in my appreciation.

<h3 id="metronome">Metronome</h3>

This application is simple. Press a button at the rate of a song, and it will output the tempo of the song you're listening to. I produce music and work a lot with samples. Quickly knowing the tempo of a song enables me to quickly work with samples and create music.

<h3 id="bird-proxy">Bird Proxy</h3>

This application is a proxy server for [Aviary](https://github.com/McCambley/hacktober-code-jam), an app that allows users travel the world via bird sounds, entering a zip code and hearing an orchestra of bird calls most recently spotted in that area. This proxy server allows the front end to get data from the [Xeno-canto API](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api) without exposing the API key to the public.
